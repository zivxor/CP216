errors1.s :
	ldr r3, A; is wrong because we need to get rid of ';' and just pass =A (adress of value at label)
	ldr r0, [r3] is correctly loading value at adress A that we stored in r3
 	ldr r3, B: is also incorrect, drop the ':' and just pass =B as the operand to load adress of label
	ldr r1, [r3] is correctly loading value at Adress in r3 from memory to r1
	add r2, r1, [r0] is incorrect because arm only supports direct values and registers as operants, also  we already--- 
			---derefferenced the memory adress in r0 when we loaded into it so this wouldnt make sense

	ldr r3, =Result correctly loads adress of result in register 3
	str r2, [r3] this is correct

errors2.s :
	ldr r3, =First correctly loads adress of First into r3
	ldr r0, [r3] correctly loads value from adress in r3 to r0
	ldr r3, =Second correctly loads adress of Seciond into r3 replacing adress of First
	ldr r1, [r3] correctly stores value of Second in r1 from memory adress in r3
	add r2, r0, r1 correctly adds the two values into r2
	ldr r3, =Total correctly leady the memory adress of memory allocated to Total 
	str r2, r3 incorrect syntax, we need to pass adress of r3 like this [r3] in order to store r2 in the memory allocated to Total
	sub r2, r0, r1 correctly replaces sum of r0 and r1 in r2 with the difference
	ldr r3, =Difff correctly loads aress of  memory allocated to Diff to r3, however you have to be careful for typo's Diff was declared with 2 f's not 3
	str r2, r3 again incorrectly storing, we need [r3] to store difference in r2 in the memory allocated to Diff
	.space 2 // Set aside 4 bytes for difference says allocates 4 bytes but only actually allocates 2 bytes so not sure if this is intentional or not ---
			--- but 16 bits might lead to space problems

errors3.s : 
	// Copy contents of first element of Vec1 to Vec2

	ldr r0, =Vec1 correctly loads adress of first value under label Vec1, stores in r0
	ldr r1, =Vec2 correctly does the same for Vec2 but vec 2 onlu has one value, stores in r1
	ldr r2, [r0] correctly loads value at memory adress stored in r0 int rd
	str r2, [r1] correctly stores value at r2 in the memory adress stored in r1
	
	// Copy contents of second element of Vec1 to Vec2

	add r0, r0, #2 increments adress in r0 by 2 bytes but instructionn are are stores in adresses of 4 bytes length so to get to second element of Vec1 do #4 instead of 2
	add r1, r1, #2 increments adress in r1 by 2 aswell but same thing, you want to increment by 4 not 2 if you wanna get to free memory 
	ldr r2, [r0] loads new value from adress of next element under Vec1 into register 2
	str r2, [r1] correctly loads value from register 2 into new adress stored in r1
	
	// Copy contents of second element of Vec1 to Vec2 -- Not sure why it says second but at this point it would be copying the third element because we alreaduy incremented once
	
	add r1, r1, #4 correctly incremented memory adress but why are we incrementing r1 two times and would be then copying second element of Vec1 in Vec2 after skipping 4 byted of memory  
	add r1, r1, #4 correctly incremented memory adress
	ldr r2, [r0] correctly loads value from memory adress stored in r0 into r2
	str r2, [r2] this line is incorrect, it stores the value at r2 in the adress of r2 which doesnt make sense because r2 holds a value, so you probably means to pass [r1] for copy to adress that we ---
			--- prevoiously incremented 
	Vec2: .word 6 -- Note that .word allocated 4 bytes of memory, given our program we probably want to allocate .space 12 for the .bss for 3 elements or .word 6, 0, 0 to allocate 12 bytes total in data---
			--- but i dont know why you would do that wen you would change the 6 right away anyways. 

	Not really sure what this program was going for because it was super horribly written but i think i caught on and corrected it to the intended function. Also i noticed that Vec2 is under .bss which is the
	uninitialized data section. This isnt really an error but i think that its wrong because it is initialized so not quite sure what the goal was but if you want to keep it in uninitialized data then you 
	should use .space 12 and not initialize values or just put in the data section and initialize two more elements to 0; Not sure if you can initialiaze data under .bss and if it'll get moved automatically 
	to data region but I would stick to proper good assembly habits.
